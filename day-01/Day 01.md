# HTML CSS module

### HTML Structure

- *< !DOCTYPE html> Doctype* -> It is a required preamble. They don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly.

- *< html > </ html >* -> Root element
- < head> </ head> This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.

- <body></body> This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page

- < html lang="en"> lenguaje por defecto

- < meta charset="UTF-8"> encode type format to make it alphabet readable

- < meta name="viewport" content="width=<>, initial-scale=1.0"> this allows to make the width custom to the curren device, a part of responsibility.

- to generate the structure automatically just html:5 and enter and the generate for you.

- `<a hrefe=""><a>` for links. You can include `rel="noreferrer noopener"` para no dejar información de donde viene 

- Shortcut for list tag ul>li#*3 and creates a list of 3 items
